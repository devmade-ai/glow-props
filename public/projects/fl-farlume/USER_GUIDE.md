# User Guide

Everything you need to know about using Farlume to track and forecast your spending.

---

## Getting Started

Farlume is a cashflow tracking tool that runs entirely on your device. No accounts, no cloud, no sign-ups. Your data stays in your browser and never leaves your device.

When you first open the app, a **Demo Household** workspace is created automatically with realistic sample data — salary, rent, groceries, and more. This lets you explore all the features before creating your own workspace.

You can also reopen the tutorial any time from the **menu** (hamburger icon) in the top-right corner.

## Workspaces

A workspace is the top-level container for your transactions, recurring patterns, and forecasts.

### Creating a Workspace

1. From the home screen, click **New Workspace** (or **Create your first workspace** if you have none yet)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Workspace name** — Give it a meaningful name (e.g. "Household", "Side Business")
   - **Currency symbol** — The symbol shown next to amounts (e.g. "R", "$", "€"). Display only — doesn't do conversions
   - **Period type** — Choose **Monthly** (rolling view) or **Custom dates** (fixed start and end dates)
   - **Start date** / **End date** — Only shown for custom-date workspaces. End date is optional
3. Click **Create workspace**

### Editing a Workspace

1. Open the workspace you want to edit
2. Click the **⋮** menu (three dots) in the top-right, then **Edit workspace**
3. Change any fields and click **Save changes**

### Deleting a Workspace

1. Open the workspace
2. Click the **⋮** menu, then **Delete workspace**
3. A confirmation dialog will explain what gets deleted: the workspace, all its transactions, patterns, and imported data
4. Click **Delete workspace** to confirm, or **Cancel** to go back

### Exporting a Workspace

1. Open the workspace
2. Click the **⋮** menu, then **Export**
3. A JSON file downloads to your device containing the workspace and all its data
4. Use this file as a backup or to move your workspace to another device

### Restoring from a Backup

1. From the home screen, click **Restore** (or **Restore from file** if you have no workspaces)
2. Select a previously exported JSON file
3. If a workspace with the same ID already exists, you'll be asked whether to **Replace** it or **Cancel**
4. The workspace and all its data will be restored

### Clearing All Data

1. From the home screen, scroll to the bottom and click **Clear all data**
2. A confirmation dialog warns that this deletes everything permanently

## The Dashboard

When you open a workspace, you see a single-screen dashboard with three sections:

### Cash on Hand

At the top, there's a **Cash on hand** input where you can enter how much cash you currently have. This is saved to the workspace automatically.

- Enter any amount and the app shows your projected end balance or when your cash runs out
- The forecast is based on your recurring patterns and transaction history

### Cashflow Graph

An interactive line chart showing:
- **Historical transactions** — your actual daily cashflow
- **Forecast** — projected future cashflow based on patterns (shown as a dashed line)

### Metrics Grid

Key financial metrics at a glance:
- Transaction counts and totals
- Forecast accuracy (MAE, hit rate) when enough historical data exists
- Runway information (when cash on hand is set)

### Transaction Table

A list of all transactions in the workspace, showing date, description, amount, and tags.

---

## Importing Transactions

The import wizard lets you upload your bank statement and review transactions before importing. It's a 2-step process.

For details on file format, supported columns, and a ready-to-copy AI prompt for converting bank statements, open **Import Format** from the menu. A **Sample CSV** is also available there to test with.

### Step 1: Upload File

1. From the workspace, click **Import**
2. Click **Choose a file** and select a CSV or JSON file (max 10 MB)
3. The app reads your file and auto-detects which columns contain dates, amounts, and descriptions
4. A preview table shows the first few rows
5. Select the correct columns if auto-detection was wrong
6. Choose the correct date format if auto-detection was wrong
7. Click **Continue to classify**

Duplicate transactions (matching date, amount, and description) are automatically skipped.

### Step 2: Review & Import

Each transaction is shown individually in a paginated list. For each one you can:

- **Classify** as Recurring or Once-off (transactions matching existing patterns are auto-classified)
- **Add tags** with autocomplete from your existing tag vocabulary
- **See ML tag suggestions** — the app suggests relevant tags using zero-shot classification
- **Set variability** — for recurring transactions: Fixed, Variable, or Irregular
- **Ignore** — toggle to skip importing this transaction

Transactions that match existing recurring patterns (by exact description or fuzzy similarity) are highlighted with the matched pattern name.

Use **Mark all unmatched as once-off** to quickly classify remaining transactions.

When ready, click **Import transactions** to save. You'll be redirected back to the workspace dashboard.
