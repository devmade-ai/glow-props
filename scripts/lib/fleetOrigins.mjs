// Requirement: two audits now need the same answer to "what are the fleet's
//   live origins, and which project does each belong to" —
//   audit-discoverability.mjs grades them, audit-cross-links.mjs checks that
//   links between them still point somewhere real.
// Approach: one module resolves it from the mirrored project metadata, so a
//   project added to the portfolio joins BOTH audits without anyone remembering
//   to. gp-props is not among its own mirrors, so it is named explicitly.
// Why extracted rather than exported from audit-discoverability.mjs: importing
//   that file runs it — it is a top-level-await script, not a library. Two
//   copies of the resolution would be two things to forget on the next move,
//   which is the rule src/lib/structuredData.js already records for the origin
//   constant itself.
