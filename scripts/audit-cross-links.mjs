// Requirement: nothing verifies that a hardcoded URL in one fleet site pointing
//   at another fleet site still goes anywhere real. Found the hard way
//   2026-08-07: tool-till-tees shipped an "Open See Veo App →" button — the only
//   call to action on the page — pointing at devmade-ai.github.io/see-veo/, dead
//   since see-veo left GitHub Pages. Its typecheck, 588 tests and build all
//   passed either side of the fix, because a cross-project URL has no build
//   step, no type and no test that can notice the other end moved. It was caught
//   only because a rename sweep happened to grep for 'github.io'.
//
// Approach: check the DEPLOYED output, not repo source. Fetch every tracked
//   origin, follow its own script bundles, collect the absolute URLs actually
//   shipped, and judge each against the canonical origins in
//   public/projects/*/meta.json.
//
// Why not "grep each repo's source", which is how this was first scoped:
//   1. audit-discoverability.mjs already rejects source-based grading in its own
//      header, for a reason that applies verbatim here — "a repo containing
//      public/robots.txt and an origin serving robots.txt are different facts".
//      A link in source and a link in the shipped bundle are different facts
//      too, and only the second one can hurt a user.
//   2. gp-props has no access to sibling repo source. Checking it would mean
//      pulling 18 repos over the API on every run, to inspect the less relevant
//      of the two facts.
//   The tool-till-tees bug was visible in the deployed bundle — that is how the
//   fix was verified — so the deployed view is sufficient as well as correct.
//
// Two failure modes, deliberately distinguished:
//   DEAD  — does not resolve. The tool-till-tees case.
//   STALE — resolves, but is not the origin this project is served from now. A
//           404 is loud; a stale origin still answering is the duplicate-content
//           trap DISCOVERABILITY.md exists to prevent, and it looks fine.
//
// Why not a deploy gate: same reason as audit-discoverability.mjs. This reaches
//   third-party hosts, and someone else's 503 must not block publishing.
//
// Run: npm run audit:cross-links [--check] [--json]
